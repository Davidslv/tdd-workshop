# Holiday Agency

Write some code that will tell us what villas are available on weeks where flights are also available

**Use stubs to act as facades to external systems.**

### Villa booking system

Tell it the week and year (e.g. week 26, 2011) and it will return an array of villa names that are available

### Flight booking system

Tell it the week and the year and the start/destination airports and it will tell you if flights are available in that week

Example: London Heathrow (LHR) -> Paphos International (PFO)
