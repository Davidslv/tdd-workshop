# Bank Account

Write some code to transfer a specified amount of money from one bank account (the payer) to another (the payee).

1. Write the assertion first and work backwards
2. Run the test to ensure it fails in the way you expect it to
3. Write meaningful tests that are self- explanatory
4. Tests should only have one reason to fail
5. Triangulate through concrete examples towards general solutions
