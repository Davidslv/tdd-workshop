# TDD-WORKSHOP

This repository aims to share some testing techniques.
Keep in mind that the code you will see reflects the final stage, it doesn't guide
you through the process of refactoring your code (and test), that's why you should
read the [exercises](exercises/) beforehand and try it yourself.

You should use this repository as a reference.
